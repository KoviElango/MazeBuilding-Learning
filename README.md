# Maze Solver Visualizer

A visual tool built with Python and Pygame to generate and solve mazes using multiple algorithms.

## Features

- Maze generation using randomized depth-first search (DFS)
- Maze solving using:
  - Left Wall Follower
  - Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
  - A* Search (planned)
- Interactive graphical interface with buttons
- Live visualization of both maze generation and solving

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Pygame 2.6 or higher

Install dependencies with:
- pip install pygame

Controls:
- Select an algorithm from the right-hand sidebar
- Click **Play** to solve the maze using the selected algorithm
- Click **Reset** to generate a new maze
- Click **Exit** to close the application
